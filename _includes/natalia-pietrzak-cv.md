I am a creator, I always loved building something new: be it through writing, drawing or coding. As for frontend development, I love that my work can be experienced live in the browser and that I can publish anything in just a few minutes.

The three values closest to my heart are: order, meaning and simplicity. I fear for the future of humanity, so I don't want to throw more senseless evil out there - I would love to take part in a meaningful, nature- and future-friendly projects. I try to maintain good work/life balance, so I avoid toxic environments.

## Skills

I have strong frontend development skills with some backend experience. I can do identity design, UI design and illustration - I mainly use Illustrator, Sketch, Photoshop and InDesign. I am no stranger to Scrum, Kanban, recruitment, introducing new people into projects and copywriting. I’m familiar with all the OSs, but my favourite setup is MacOS with Atom.

Technologies I would love to work with: **TypeScript** or **ES6**, **Vue**, **React**, **Angular**, **NPM**, **cssnext** and **RESTful APIs**. I would also like to have **TDD**, **code reviews**, **pair programming**, **code linting** and good planning with estimations.

Some technologies I worked with: HTML (Twig), CSS (Compass, Sass, cssnext, BEM, MADCSS), JavaScript (TypeScript, CoffeeScript, ES6 [Babel], Angular, React, Vue, Alt, Backbone, Phaser, Lodash, jQuery, TweenMax), TDD (Karma, Jasmine, PhantomJS, Cypress, Selenium), Grunt, NPM, Git, CEF, Jekyll, MySQL, PHP (Symfony2), Jira, Asana.
